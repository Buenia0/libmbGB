Game Boy (Color) emulation library, sorta

The goal here is to do things right and fast (like melonDS). But, also, you know, to have a fun challenge... :)

# Features

Able to run most commercial Game Boy (and some commercial Game Boy Color) titles

Exclusive "hybrid mode" that combines the Game Boy Color's DMG mode with emulation of some of the Game Boy's DMG-exclusive bugs, including the STAT IRQ bug that Legend of Zerd (aka. Zerd no Densetsu) relies on

And more to come!

# Plans

## Near-term

Near cycle-accurate Gameboy (Color) support
